TO INSTALL CATS:

1) Open CMakeLists.txt and change all highlighed paths.
2) run in terminal: source configure.sh
3) unless there are errors, run in terminal: make
                                             make install

you may need to do:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mypath${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

to make sure the librieries are accessible at runtime. mypath would be the path to the lib folder where CATS is installed
