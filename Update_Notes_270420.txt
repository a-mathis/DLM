please note the new files, that you will need to add to you CMakeList
In order to compile, you might need to REMOVE the files 'DLM_SmearedCats.cpp(h)' from the CMakeList

In summary: this update is done in order to make a dream come true: CATS without ROOT by replacing TH2F with DLM_Histo<float>

with this update I have removed completely the ROOT requirement in the DLM_CkDecomposition object (now renamed DLM_CkDecomp)
In order to keep backwards compatibility, the class DLM_CkDecomposition is reimplemented, where it keeps the out input arguments (including TH2F)
but converts them to the DLM_CkDecomp format.

I have also provided a DLM_RootWrapper, which provides to functions needed to convert TH2F <-> DLM_Histo<float>

TROUBLESHOOTING:

the only real problems I had with the new code, is that the TH2F include was carried around by the DLM_CkDecomposition.h, while now it is not. Thus if you were sloppy (as I was) with the includes, you may have to #include "TH2F.h" in the files where you get a compilation error.
