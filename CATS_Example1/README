------ CATS ------
 *EXAMPLE MACRO 1*
-------------------
This is an example macro using CATS, including a compilation script that works under linux (bash).
To compile this macro please set all required paths in "CompileCATS.sh" and make it executable. 
Finally run "source CompileCATS.sh" and the executable will be created in ./bin/

The main.cpp has some basic examples with comments, which illustrate how CATS can be used 
to compute the correlation function.
