------ CATS ------
 *GETTING STARTED*
-------------------
This text gives a short intro to CATS, some real documentation will emerge in the future.
The code is provided "as is" and the authors will take no responsibility in case of any issues 
related to the interpretation of results analyzed with the help of this framework.
Nevertheless in case of suspected problems with the code we would gladly provide feedback and support.

1) What is CATS
CATS is a femtoscopy analysis tool, capable of computing the correlation function C(k)
given a source and a strong interaction potetnial. The wave-function is evaluated by
solving the Schroedinger equation numerically. => the tool is non-relativistic and will
only work for particles with masses of more then c.a. 500 MeV (light mesons are off-limits).

2) How to download/compile
You can download CATS from here: http://www.denseandstrange.ph.tum.de/index.php?id=78
There are 3 folders included: CATS, DLM_CppTools and CATS_Example1. CATS contains the main source-code for CATS.
DLM_CppTools contains some functions used by CATS, developed by the authors for previous projects.
You need to include and compile all *.cpp and *.h files from those folders in your own code.

We do not offer any specific option for compilation or installation, except for the macro included in the CATS_Example folder.

3) How to use it
You can see some example code of using CATS in the folder named CATS_Example1.
With the help of the comments you should be capable of understanding how to run CATS.
Nevertheless there a few things that we would like to bring your attention to:
  * Both the potential and the analytic source should be defined as functions in your code and passed on to CATS
  * The arrays used together with those potential are both memory-holders and a way to connect CATS to the "outer world"
  * For the potential: The first 2 arguments sould be the variables "r" and "k". The array passed to CATS should have a minimum size of 2.
  * For the source: The first 3 arguments sould be the variables "k","r","θ". The array passed to CATS should have a minimum size of 3.
  * Any arguments beyond the default minimum can be used as a link between CATS and external functions, an example is available in the macro.
  * The PdgId parameter is currently used to determine if the particles are identical or not and when sampling the source from a data file.
  
4) Prerequisites
  * GSL - GNU Scientific Library (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
